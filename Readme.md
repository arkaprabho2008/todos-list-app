# Todos-List-App

This is my todos list application . This is my test project without any backend . I just wanted to create a project using javascript . 
And this application uses localstorage to keep record of todos . We can add a todo . View them and also delete them . All the todos are organised in form of a list .
The html is done mostly0 using bootstrap .
